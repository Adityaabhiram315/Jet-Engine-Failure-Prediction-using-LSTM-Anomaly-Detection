# Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction-using-LSTM-Anomaly-Detection

This project implements a predictive maintenance system for jet engine components using LSTM-based deep learning and sensor telemetry. The goal is to predict failures and detect anomalies ahead of time, improving aviation safety, operational uptime, and maintenance efficiency.

ðŸ”‘ APIs Used in the Project (FROM AVIATION EDGE $ 7 USD / month)
1.) Airline Routes API

-Used to build the real-world flight network graph.

-Provided direct and indirect routes between global airport pairs.

-Enabled accurate edge creation in graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall).

2.)Real-time Schedules API

-Fetched current flight timings and frequencies to simulate real-time routing.

-Helped dynamically update edge weights (travel time, delays) in the graph.

-Made the simulation closer to a live operational scenario.

3.)Historical Schedules API

-Used to validate algorithmic results by comparing optimized paths with real historical flight durations and paths.

Helped estimate actual time reduction (~7%).
